## Project Proposal

### Project Overview: The Harmonisation of Fungi and Regret (Phase 2: Neural Ingestion)

Our proposed project centres on developing and delivering arts programs that are deeply rooted in Hobart's unique cultural identity while pushing creative boundaries. Specifically, we seek urgent funding to finalise our four-year investigation into the latent telepathic signals emitted by *Lycogala epidendrum* (Wolf's Milk Slime Mould) found beneath the boardwalk at MONA. Our preliminary research proves this mould is a living archive of every poor decision made on a first date within a 5km radius.

### Project Objectives

1. **Cultivate Artistic Excellence Through Bio-Acoustic Neural Synchronicity**
   - Construct a bio-acoustic helmet (patent pending) to achieve full neural synchronicity with the slime mould's collective consciousness
   - Support the ingestion of the mould's regret-data by our lead artist
   - Facilitate "automatic writings" on repurposed Boral plasterboard, translating the psychic weight of failed romantic encounters

2. **Strengthen Community Connections**
   - Create accessible arts experiences for Hobart residents
   - Build bridges between artists and audiences
   - Develop inclusive programs that reflect community diversity

3. **Enhance Hobart's Cultural Profile Through Critical Inquiry**
   - Position Hobart as a centre for arts innovation by finally answering the question: "What if paint, but sad?"
   - Attract attention to local artistic talent and their ability to commune with slime mould consciousness
   - Contribute to the city's cultural tourism appeal through appointment-only viewings

4. **Build Sustainable Arts Infrastructure**
   - Establish ongoing support systems for artists
   - Create pathways for emerging creative practitioners
   - Develop partnerships with local venues and organisations

### Project Activities

#### Core Program Components

**1. Artist Development Programs (Bio-Acoustic Neural Integration Division)**
- Residencies beneath the MONA boardwalk for extended slime mould observation
- Mentorship in telepathic signal interpretation and regret-data ingestion protocols
- Access to bio-acoustic helmet technology and repurposed Boral plasterboard
- Showcasing opportunities for completed works (viewable only by persons named "Greg")

**2. Public Arts Events (The Regret Archive Series)**
- Exhibition: A pile of plasterboard containing automatic writings of first-date failures
- Performances synchronized with lunar cycles (funding required before next full moon)
- Interactive experiences limited to audience members named "Greg" (by appointment only)
- Collaboration with MONA boardwalk maintenance staff for ongoing slime mould access

**3. Community Engagement (Psychic Weight Awareness Programs)**
- Workshops on identifying telepathic signals in local fungi populations
- Artist talks: "My Journey Into Slime Mould Consciousness" panel series
- Open studio events featuring live regret-data ingestion sessions
- Youth arts initiatives: "Is Your Date Going Badly? The Slime Mould Knows"

**4. Documentation and Promotion**

## Conclusion

This application represents Secret Lab (The Hobart Division)'s urgent commitment to fostering artistic excellence and cultural vitality through the critical investigation of *Lycogala epidendrum* consciousness. Through focused support for local artists, neural synchronicity with slime mould entities, and delivery of appointment-only plasterboard exhibitions viewable exclusively by individuals named "Greg", we will contribute meaningfully to Tasmania's cultural landscape.

Our Hobart-centric, MONA-boardwalk-focused approach ensures that funding will have maximum impact on the documentation of romantic regret within a 5km radius. This work is critical. We are confident that this project will create lasting value for artists, Gregs, and the psychically-burdened slime moulds of Hobart.

We respectfully—yet urgently—request Arts Tasmania's support to bring this vision to life before the next full moon, thereby strengthening Hobart's position as a thriving centre for bio-acoustic neural arts and the harmonisation of fungi and regret.
